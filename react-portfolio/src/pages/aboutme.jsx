            <p>My name is Vijay Natarajan. I am a dedicated full-stack developer specializing in building scalable and high-performance web applications using React for dynamic front-end experiences and Node.js for efficient server-side development. With a strong foundation in both relational and NoSQL databases, I leverage PostgreSQL for structured data management and NoSQL solutions like MongoDB for flexible, scalable storage. My expertise spans designing RESTful APIs, optimizing backend performance, and implementing secure authentication and authorization mechanisms. I am passionate about writing clean, maintainable code, and continuously learning new technologies to stay ahead in the ever-evolving web development landscape.</p>
